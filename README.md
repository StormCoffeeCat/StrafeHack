StrafeHack source code leak since it's dead

I was one of the original devs and while I left the GitHub organization that was working on this I still had this in my Repls, and since the project is to dead I decided to publish the source code. The last commit on the original repo was around July last time I checked, so I don't mean any harm doing this. Fork it and improve it however you want.
